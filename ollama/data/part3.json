It stopped working, even though I haven't had it for very long. I expected it to last much longer than this.\n\nMan: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Our warranty covers products for up to a year. Do you know when you bought it?\n\nWoman: I've had it for a little over a year, so the warranty is probably just expired. This is so disappointing.\n\nMan: Well, I'll tell you what we can do. Although we can't replace it, since you're a valued customer, I can offer you a coupon for 40% off your next purchase.",

Don't you usually work at the hotel in the morning?\n\nWoman: Actually, I'm going to be working the evening shift for a while. I'm covering for a front desk supervisor who was just promoted, but only until the hotel hires a permanent replacement.\n\nMan: Oh, so there's a front desk supervisor position open. I've been looking for a chance at a managerial role. Are they still accepting applications?\n\nWoman: Yes, and if you don't mind working evening hours, I think you have a good chance at the job. I'd contact the manager right now, though. She's starting interviews this week.",
